# 📜 Prescify

## 🚀 Mission
Prescify aims to revolutionize prescription verification using blockchain technology. Our mission is to eliminate prescription fraud, enhance data security, and create a transparent, decentralized healthcare system where medical records are immutable, accessible, and verifiable by authorized users only.

## 🌍 Vision
We envision a future where prescription verification is seamless, trustless, and universally accessible. By integrating blockchain, smart contracts, and decentralized storage, Prescify strives to build a tamper-proof, patient-centric system that enhances the integrity of digital healthcare and ensures medical authenticity worldwide.

Prescify is built with compliance to privacy laws. It does not store any user-related data without encryption. Prescription issuance and medicine dispensation are handled by registered and verified professionals.
